# Artificial Speech Recognition

Welcome to **Artificial Speech Recognition**, a Python-based project dedicated to building and experimenting with automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. This repository provides code, datasets, and documentation for developing models that transcribe spoken language into text, with a focus on research and practical applications.

## 🚀 Features

- **End-to-End Speech Recognition:** Implementations of ASR pipelines using deep learning frameworks.
- **Preprocessing Tools:** Audio loading, feature extraction (MFCC, spectrogram), and data augmentation utilities.
- **Model Architectures:** Support for CNNs, RNNs (LSTM/GRU), Transformers, and attention mechanisms.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Scripts for model training, validation, and testing; metrics for accuracy and error rate.
- **Dataset Integration:** Ready-to-use loaders for popular speech datasets (e.g., LibriSpeech, Common Voice).
- **Inference & Demo:** Simple interface to run inference on audio files and visualize transcriptions.

## ⚡ Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sayak-Pal/Artificial-Speech-Recognition.git
   cd Artificial-Speech-Recognition
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Download or prepare data:**
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - (Optional) Use provided scripts for dataset preprocessing.
4. **Train a model:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --mode train --config configs/your_config.yaml
   ```
5. **Run inference:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --mode infer --audio path/to/audio.wav
   ```

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

- **Custom Models:** Add new architectures in the `models/` directory.
- **Experimentation:** Use notebooks for prototyping and visualization.
- **Evaluation:** Check results and model performance in the `results/` folder.
